💡 TIPS

Copy files one by one - don't miss any
Check file extensions - .js for JavaScript, .json for JSON
Verify .env files - these are critical and not in artifacts
Test frequently - after each major section
Read error messages - they usually tell you what's wrong
Use browser DevTools - check Console and Network tabs
